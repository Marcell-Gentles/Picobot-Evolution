So far, the project has been fairly straightforward. Writing the step method for the World class was a bit tricky because of the translation from cardinal directions to row and column changes. Our final tasks are to write the genetic methods, including mutate and crossover for Program, fractionVisitedCells for World, and the general evaluateFitness and GA functions. We have gotten a better understanding of the complexity involved in extrapolating this program to rooms beyond the empty rectangle, and now believe that it may be beyond the scope of our project.
