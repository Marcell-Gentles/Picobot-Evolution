# Final Project: Powering Picobot via Genetic Algorithms

How we tested your code and chose the parameters of your genetic algorithm, e.g.,
What fraction of each population you decided to be fit enough to "mate".
x
How you arranged the mating and mutations.
x

How well your overall fittest evolved Picobot program performed and how it did so.
x
Please include your most-fit Picobot program, too, in a comment—along with its fitness—that way, we can run it!
